ðŸš€ How to Use
1. First-Time Installation
If this is your first time using the tool, you need to install the dependencies.

Download the WhisperOneClickInstaller.bat script from this repository.

Right-click the file and select "Run as administrator".

Wait for the script to complete. It will install Python, FFmpeg, PyTorch, and Whisper. This may take some time.



2. Launching the Application
Double-click the LaunchWhisperUI.bat file.

A command prompt window will open, and the web interface will automatically launch in your default browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

The command prompt window must remain open while you use the application.
